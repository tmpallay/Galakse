                <p class = "text">
                    The purpose of galaksē is to give members of West Virginia University’s IEEE student branch 
                    access to a collection of old exams, homework assignments, and other resources via any computer or smartphone. 
                    It is kept alive with the goal that students will use this material to excel in their Computer Science, 
                    Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Biometric Systems courses, along with others.
                    
                    galaksē is maintained by and available only to paying members of WVU IEEE. Contact us by email to learn more.
